## Question
After starting my studies, I wanted to play around with LaTeX. So I built a web-based editor! Unfortunately, people have tried hacking it, so I needed to blacklist some commands. But I’m sure it’s 100% secure now! :) I also made the app restart if it crashes, I just hope that people can’t abuse that for something. But hey, it’s just a restart, right? What could possibly go wrong?

As it turns out, my blacklist was a bit flawed and people once again hacked my website. Now I’ve made it even more secure!

## Solution
Funny enough the same command used in [this challenge](https://github.com/Rishblol/CTF-Solves/blob/main/Platypwn2024/Texnically%20Insecure.md) works here too:

flag: ```PP{g3t-t3x3d-by-l3g4cy-c0mm4nd5::5Sp-Obxkbcq1}```
